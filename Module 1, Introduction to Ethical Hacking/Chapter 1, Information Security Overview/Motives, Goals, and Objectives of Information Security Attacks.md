Attackers (generally) have motives/goals (otherwise they wouldn't be doing what they are doing!). A motive originates out of the idea that a target system has something valuable -> threat for an attack on that system. Once an attacker determines their goal, they can employ tools, attack techniques, and methods to try and exploit vulnerabilities.

# Attacks = Motive (Goals) + Method + Vulnerability
