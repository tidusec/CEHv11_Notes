According to IATF (International Automotive Task Force?), security attacks are classified into five categories: passive, active, close-in, insider and distribution.

1. Passive Attacks
	Passive attacks involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic and data flow on the target network and **they don't tamper with the data**
	Examples of passive attacks:
	- Footprinting
	- Sniffing and eavesdropping
	- Network traffic analysis
	- Decryption of weakly encrypted traffic
2. Active Attacks
	Active attacks, contrary to (1) will tamper with data as much as possibly. They will try to bypass or break into security systems. 
	Examples of active attacks:
	- DoS (Denial-of-service)
	- Bypassing of protection systems
	- Malware attacks
	- Modification of information
	- Spoofing attacks
	- Replay attacks
	- Privilege escalation
	- ...
3. Close-in Attacks
	Close-in attacks are performed when the attacker is in close physical proximity with the target system or network. For example, an attacker might shoulder surf user credentials. Attackers can gain close proximity through surreptitious entry, open access, or both.
	Examples of close-in attacks:
	- Social engineering (Eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, ...)
4. Insider Attacks
   Insider attacks are performed by trusted persons who have physical access to the critical assets of the target. An insider attack involves using privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause a threat to the organization's information or information systems.
   Examples of insider attacks:
	- Eavesdropping and wiretapping
	- Theft of physical devices
	- Social engineering
	- Data theft and spoliation
	- Pod slurping
	- Planting keyloggers, backdoors, or malware
	- ...
5. Distribution Attacks
	Distribution attacks occur when attackers tamper with hardware or software prior to the installation. 
	Examples of distribution attacks:
	- Modification of software or hardware during production or distribution
